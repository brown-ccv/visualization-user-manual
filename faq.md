# FAQ

**Q: Can CCV help me acquiring data?**

A:  The short answer is yes, but it depends the kind of data you want to acquire. We have a list of providers who can help us with scanners to retrieve data and export it to a file we can analyze. Most of the time users already have those files and they ask us support to visualize it.

**Q: My data is too large to fit on conventional devices, where or how can I store it?**

A: Brown University \(and other institutions\) counts with  general purpose storing servers that can help you saving, administrating  and access your data it from anywhere in the world \(as long as you have an internet connection\).
