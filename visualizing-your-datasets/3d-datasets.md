# 3D DataSets

### 3D Data

Contrary to its two dimensional counter part, three-dimensional \(3D\) data comes in several shapes.

* Meshes: It is structural build of a 3D model based on polygons. Every point in a mesh represents a point in space called vertex. This point is connected to  two or more vertices creating a base geometry shape such as triangles and quads. Connecting multiple triangles together, they form a three dimensional structure that can be displayed on a monitor.

* Point Cloud: It's a set of georeferenced points.  They ****provide high-resolution data without the distortion sometimes present in 3D mesh models and are commonly used in industry-standard software.

* Volume data: in a nutshell, it is a set of 2D sliced images that stack together forming a regular pattern assembling a 3D structure. Most of the time this type of data is acquired by a CT, MRI, or MicroCT scanner.

* Height elevation data: This type of data is used to display terrains. Usually one of the channels in the data contains information on a displacement or height from the floor of a surface.
