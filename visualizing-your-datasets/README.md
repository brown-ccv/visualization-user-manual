# Visualizing your DataSets



### Visualizing your DataSets

Data come on multiple flavors. From histograms, images, meshes, volumes, etc. Nonetheless, deep down data are just numbers that represents a position, a rotation or an specific quantity.  Nowadays, the computational power of an average workstation helps us to give shape to this numbers, to transform them into something more than a binary code, to analyze and get to a meaningful result.

_We are going to go through the general knowledge pipeline to help users recognizing and understanding the process of analyze and visualize data. We will start from acknowledging  the type of data to users work with, the type of operations to perform and lastly to get the results._

First, what type of data do you work with? Are you getting Images from a particular scanner? from a camera?  from a database? Are you registering particles motion? The first step is always to know what you have in your hands in order to know what you want from it. Knowledge is power.
