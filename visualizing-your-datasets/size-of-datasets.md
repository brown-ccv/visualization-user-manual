# Size of Datasets

Additionally, how large is the dataset? How much space does it occupy in hard disk? This might affect the performance of your computer at the moment you work with it. Nowadays,  the most sophisticated scanners, microscopes and cameras produce very high definition \(HD\) images which consume a lot of space in memory. Opening a large 3D data with 4K HD quality will use most of your RAM,  and it will affect user interaction and lower  the frames per second \(fps\).

## How to work with over 4 GB datasets

Nowadays, an average personal computer can have up to 16 Gigabytes \(GB\) of [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory). More powerful gaming stations can have 32 or  48 GB. Although, the amount of RAM keeps increasing over the years, the size of data has also increased at a faster pace. Advance tech devices acquire high definition data producing files over the 4 GB, and a whole dataset easily can weight over the 30 GB.

Take in count RAM is shared across all the applications in your task bar, plus the operational system. For example, your browser can consume 3 GB, plus the music played, plus videos, plus the applications you typically work with. Leaving between 8 or 5 GB of free RAM to work with other files. Opening a single 4 GB dataset takes almost half of your available memory. At this point your computer will start slowing down affecting its performance, some applications will close automatically and you might regret opening the file.

### Getting More RAM

One solution to this problem is simply buying more RAM. At the moment this article was written the maximum RAM a standard desktop can have is 128 GB. More advance computers can get up to 2 TB. Also adding more CPU cores and  GPUs might do the trick. However, the main obstacle for this solution is budget.

#### Cons

RAM is expensive, and not all motherboards can support a high amount of it. So a modern motherboard has to be bought as well. Also, GPUs are not cheap either, and there is a point when the price for a computer with the latest gadgets gets beyond budget.

#### Pros

A high tech desktop computer with over 1 TB of RAM is extremely useful for ANY type of job. Large an heavy operations would not depend on external factors such as network lag and resource allocation. Specialized software can get results faster and export it to multiple formats such as video in real time.
